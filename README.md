Build Info
=========
* gcc 4.8.x 
* Run ./build.sh to do everything.
* cat build.sh to see the steps in case you prefer to do them manually.
* A summary of the steps is:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd build
cmake28 ..
make -j 5
cd ../external/indri-5.9
./configure
make -j 5
cd ../../src
make
cd ..
cp src/mk_wand_idx bin/mk_wand_idx
cp src/kstem_query bin/kstem_query
cp build/wand_search bin/wand_search
```

Binary Info
======
There are two important binaries.

1. bin/mk_wand_idx GOV2_STOP wand_out
This will convert the Indri Index in GOV2_STOP generated using the file
ir-repo/index-GOV2_STOP.param. The WAND index will be in the wand_out
directory.

2. bin/wand_search -c wand_out -q ir-repo/gov2-2004.qry -k 1000 -o
   gov2-2004 
   Will run queries 701-750 on the GOV2 stopped collection, and generate 
   a timing and run file with the prefix gov2-2004.

Note that the input queries must be Krovetz stemmed if the Indri index is
built with Krovetz stemming. There is no stemmer built into the query 
engine. You can use the kstem_query program to stem a text string. It
is up to you to add the query id and ; before the query. See the
example query sets in ir-repo for an example.

A note on flags
===============
**-e**: If set, a completely exhaustive search will be used rather than a 
WAND traversal.

**-i**: If set, all query terms for a given query will be used to evaluate
each candidate document. The default (that is, the -i flag not set) is to
ignore any postings lists where the maximum contribution of any
entry in this list is less than some threshold *t*, defined in util.hpp.
For example, given a query q = "the example", *t* = 0.01 and the maximum 
contribution of the term "the" = 0.004, then the postings list for "the" will 
never be utilised.
